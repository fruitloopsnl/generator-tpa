## Yeoman generator for TPA projects

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/dsFChIk.png">

## Introduction

[Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org/) is a library of polyfills and sugar which enable the use of Web Components in modern browsers. The project allows developers to build apps using the platform of tomorrow and inform the W3C of places where in-flight specifications can be further improved.

`generator-polymer` provides Polymer scaffolding using [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) (a scaffolding tool for the web), letting you easily create and customize Polymer (custom) elements via the command-line and import them using HTML Imports. This saves you time writing boilerplate code so you can start writing up the logic to your components straight away.

## Features

* A TPA Polymer element [tpa-component](https://github.com/ING-Group/tpa-component) based off the goodness of [seed-element](https://github.com/polymerelements/seed-element)
* [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester) support

## Issues

This generator clones [tpa-component](https://github.com/ING-Group/tpa-component). If you're having issues with the template files generated for those projects, please raise them on those repos as they are the canonical source.

## Installation

Install the generator
`npm install -g generator-tpa`

Make a new directory and cd into it
`mkdir -p my-project && cd $_`

Scaffold a new TPA component:
`yo tpa:component`

## Generators

Available generators:

- [tpa:component](#tpa)

**Note: Generators are to be run from the root of your app**

### TPA
Generates a reusable polymer element based on the [tpa-component workflow](https://github.com/ING-Group/tpa-component).

To preview your new element you'll want to use the [polyserve](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polyserve) tool.

Example:
```bash
mkdir -p my-foo && cd $_
yo tpa:component tpa-account-balance
polyserve
```

## Testing

The project generated by `yo tpa` contains support for [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester). The following commands are included:

Run local tests (in terminal):
```bash
gulp test:local
```

Run remote tests with [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/):
```bash
gulp test:remote
```

See the [web-component-tester readme](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester#configuration) for configuration options.
